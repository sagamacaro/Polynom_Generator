# Polynom_Generator
Random polynomial generator for scilab

Every root is generated as a value x = q/p

The code requests the maximum value of p (always positive > 0 ) and the interval of values of q (can be both positive and negative, 0 included) 

Outpput is placed in two files, root.txt which has a LaTeX format for the equations and root.txt which is a csv with the roots for every polinomial generated.
